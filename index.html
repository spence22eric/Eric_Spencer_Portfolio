          <p>
            My name is Eric Spencer. I am currently a Desktop Support Technician
            at a company called LucidHealth. Just to list a couple of things I
            currently do; I build, image, and deploy radiology reading
            workstations for all OhioHealth hospitals, which includes
            troubleshooting already deployed machines. I initially set foot into
            the IT field in 2018 when I became a Tier 1 Service Desk Analyst for
            ascena Retail Group. This really helped kick start my career as it
            gave me some basic troubleshooting skills, but more importantly, I
            greatly improved my interpersonal communication skills. This, in turn,
            helped me advocate for myself a bit more.
          </p>        
          <p>
            I'm always looking to learn new things and further my career, as well
            as my personal growth. I started looking at software development and
            decided to take a leap of faith and enrolled in the Ohio State
            University Web Development Coding Bootcamp in November of 2021. Here,
            I plan to work towards my goal of becoming a full-stack web developer.
