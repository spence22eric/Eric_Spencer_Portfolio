              <p>
                  My name is Eric Spencer. I am currently a Desktop Support Technician at a company called LucidHealth. Just to list a couple of things I currently do, I build, image, and deploy radiology reading workstations for all OhioHealth hospitals, which includes troubleshooting already deployed machines. I initially set foot into the IT field in 2018 when I became a Tier 1 Service Desk Analyst for ascena Retail Group. This really helped kick start my career as it gave me some basic troubleshooting skills, but more importantly, I greatly improved my interpersonal communication skills. This, in turn, helped me advocate for myself a bit more.

                  I'm always looking to learn new things and further my career, as well as my personal growth. I started looking at software development and decided to take a leap of faith and enroll in the Ohio State University Web Development Coding Bootcamp in November of 2021. Here, I plan to work towards my goal of becoming a full-stack web developer.
